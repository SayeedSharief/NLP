Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is highly contagious and distributed worldwide in humans. Primary VZV infection usually causes varicella and then establishes a lifelong latency in dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation of VZV leads to HZ and related complications such as postherpetic neuralgia. Age and decreased immunity against VZV are important risk factors for developing HZ. Transplant patients are at increased risk for developing HZ and related complications due to their immunocompromised status and the need for lifetime immunosuppression. Diagnosis of HZ in transplant patients is often clinically difficult, and VZV-specific antibodies should be determined by serologic testing to document prior exposure to VZV during their pre-transplant evaluation process. Although antiviral agents are available, vaccination should be recommended for preventing HZ in transplant patients considering their complicated condition and weak organ function. Currently, there are two licensed HZ vaccines, of which one is a live-attenuated vaccine and the other is a HZ subunit vaccine. Both vaccines have shown promising safety and efficacy in transplants patients and especially the subunit vaccine could be administered post-transplant since this vaccine does not contain any live virus. Larger studies are needed about safety and immunogenicity of HZ vaccines in transplant populations, and extra efforts are needed to increase vaccine usage according to guidelines.",,"varicella zoster vaccine (drug therapy)","5 (2 bromovinyl) 2' deoxyuridine (drug therapy), aciclovir (drug therapy), anticonvulsive agent (drug therapy), famciclovir (drug therapy), ganciclovir (drug therapy), lidocaine (drug therapy), measles mumps rubella vaccine, penciclovir (drug therapy), tricyclic antidepressant agent (adverse drug reaction, drug therapy), valaciclovir (drug therapy), valganciclovir (drug therapy)","herpes zoster (drug therapy, drug therapy, prevention), transplantation, vaccine immunogenicity","antiviral activity, antiviral resistance, cardiotoxicity (side effect), constipation (side effect), drug bioavailability, drug safety, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, human, immunocompromised patient, immunosuppressive treatment, JAK-STAT signaling, mixed infection, phase 3 clinical trial (topic), polypharmacy, post exposure prophylaxis, postherpetic neuralgia (drug therapy), prematurity, quality of life, review, serotonin syndrome (side effect), upregulation, virus reactivation, xerostomia (side effect)","shingrix, zostavax (Merck, United States)","Merck (United States)",,,"5 (2 bromovinyl) 2' deoxyuridine (69304-47-8, 82768-44-3), aciclovir (59277-89-3), famciclovir (104227-87-4), ganciclovir (82410-32-0), lidocaine (137-58-6, 24847-67-4, 56934-02-2, 73-78-9), penciclovir (39809-25-1), valaciclovir (124832-26-4), valganciclovir (175865-59-5, 175865-60-8, 175865-61-9, 175865-62-0, 175865-64-2, 175865-67-5)",,"Immunology, Serology and Transplantation (26), Drug Literature Index (37), Adverse Reactions Titles (38), Microbiology: Bacteriology, Mycology, Parasitology and Virology (4)",,"English","English",20180508856,,L623044122,10.3389/fimmu.2018.01632,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01632",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary academic medical center. Patients: A total of 691 adults who received solid organ transplants between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2013, without lymphocyte-depleting induction and were prescribed 3 months of HD-A prophylaxis at the time of hospital discharge. Of those patients, 54 experienced prophylaxis failure, defined as CMV detected via molecular diagnostics or on biopsy while receiving HD-A (prophylaxis failure group), and 637 did not (comparator group). Measurements and Main Results: Mean ± SD time to failure was 64 ± 23 days; 98% (53/54 patients) was attributable to viremia diagnosed via positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of these 53 patients, 34% (18 patients) were below the quantifiable range when detected. Median initial and peak CMV PCR for quantifiable readings were 1531 IU/ml (interquartile range [IQR] less than 250–2947) and 4442 IU/ml (IQR less than 250–32,500); 19 (36%) had a single detectable CMV PCR. Treatment was required in 56% (30/54 patients), with a median duration of 63 days; 40% (12 patients) were treated with valganciclovir alone, and the remainder received intravenous ganciclovir. CMV disease resulted in hospitalization in 28% (15 patients). Immunosuppression was modified in 52% (28 patients). The rate of CMV recurrence after 100 days was significantly higher in the prophylaxis failure group (59% vs 13%, p<0.0001). Higher rates of rejection; higher rates of 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft failure; and higher rates of 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality were noted in the prophylaxis failure group on univariate analysis (43% vs 30%, p=0.045; 8%, 17%, and 34% vs 4%, 12%, and 17%, p=0.006; and 6%, 17%, and 26% vs 1%, 6%, and 10%, p=0.003, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased risk of graft failure in the prophylaxis failure group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1–3.1, p=0.0499) and a trend to increased mortality (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.83–3.1, p=0.16). Conclusion: Prophylaxis failure with HD-A was mostly limited to mild viremia; however, it was associated with significantly reduced long-term graft survival, likely reflecting the negative impact of CMV viremia.",,"aciclovir (drug therapy)","basiliximab, calcineurin inhibitor, ganciclovir (drug therapy, intravenous drug administration), mycophenolic acid, steroid, valganciclovir (drug therapy)","cytomegalovirus infection (drug therapy, complication, diagnosis, drug therapy, prevention), organ transplantation","adult, article, chemoprophylaxis, cohort analysis, controlled study, drug megadose, drug treatment failure, female, graft failure (complication), graft recipient, graft rejection (complication), human, immunosuppressive treatment, kidney pancreas transplantation, kidney transplantation, liver transplantation, major clinical study, male, middle aged, mortality rate, pancreas transplantation, polymerase chain reaction, recurrence risk, retrospective study, risk factor, treatment duration",,,,,"aciclovir (59277-89-3), ganciclovir (82410-32-0), mycophenolic acid (23047-11-2, 24280-93-1), valganciclovir (175865-59-5, 175865-60-8, 175865-61-9, 175865-62-0, 175865-64-2, 175865-67-5)",,"Urology and Nephrology (28), Drug Literature Index (37), Microbiology: Bacteriology, Mycology, Parasitology and Virology (4), Gastroenterology (48), Surgery (9)",,"English","English",20180508307,,L623126668,10.1002/phar.2126,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/phar.2126",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Twenty years ago, most injuries occurred at home, precipitated by oral contact with electrical cords, contact with wall sockets and faulty electrical equipment. We sought to assess the epidemiology of electrical injuries in children presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) that participate in the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP).Methods This study is a retrospective review of electrical and lightning injury data from CHIRPP. The study population included children and youth aged 0-19 presenting to participating CHIRPP EDs from 1997-2010. Age, sex, year, setting, circumstance and disposition were extracted. Variables were tested using Fisher's exact test and simple linear regression.Results The dataset included 1183 electrical injuries, with 84 (7%) resulting in hospitalization. Most events occurred at home in the 2-5 year age group and affected the hands. Since 1997 there has been a gradual decrease in the number of electrical injuries per year (p<0.01) and there is an annual surge in electrical injuries over the summer (p<0.01). Forty-six percent of injuries involved electrical outlets, 65% of injuries involved some sort of electrical equipment. Injuries due to lightning were rare (n=19). No deaths were recorded in the database.Conclusion Despite the decrease in the number of electrical injuries per year, a large portion of injuries still appear to be preventable.

Various studies have suggested that apigenin has inhibitory effects towards several drug transporters, such as the organic anion transporting (OAT) polypeptides, 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3). However, the mechanism by which apigenin interacts with OAT1 has not been well studied. Methods MDCK cells stably-expressing OAT1 were used to examine the inhibitory effects of apigenin on OAT1. UPLC–MS/MS was used to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effects of apigenin on the uptake of acyclovir by OAT1. Cytotoxicity was determined by the cell viability, MTT assays. Results Apigenin effectively inhibited the activity of OAT1 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.737 μM. Pre-incubation of cells with apigenin caused a time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of OAT1. Additionally, we examined the interactions between apigenin and acyclovir or adefovir. Data showed that apigenin (1 μM) significantly blocked the uptake of acyclovir by OAT1 in vitro with an inhibition rate of 55%. In vivo, apigenin could increase the concentration of acyclovir in plasma when co-administered with acyclovir. Importantly, the MTT assays showed that, at a dose of 50 μM, apigenin significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of adefovir and substantially increased cell viability from 50.6% to 112.62%. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that apigenin regulates OAT1, and can cause TDI or herb-drug interaction (HDI) when used in combination with acyclovir or adefovir. Therefore, apigenin could be used as a nephroprotective agent when used in combination with the substrates of OAT1.",,"apigenin (pharmacology), organic anion transporter 1 (endogenous compound)","aciclovir (drug concentration), adefovir, baicalein, emodin, probenecid, wogonin","herb drug interaction","animal cell, animal experiment, animal model, article, cell viability, controlled study, cytotoxicity, dose response, drug blood level, in vitro study, in vivo study, male, mass spectrometry, MTT assay, nonhuman, rat, time-dependent inhibition, ultra performance liquid chromatography",,,,,"aciclovir (59277-89-3), adefovir (106941-25-7), apigenin (520-36-5), baicalein (491-67-8), emodin (518-82-1, 57828-45-2), probenecid (57-66-9), wogonin (632-85-9)",,"Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry (29), Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology (30), Drug Literature Index (37)",,"English","English",20170791688,29128807,L619122933,10.1016/j.pharep.2017.06.012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2017.06.012",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In Algeria, Health-care insurance covered, 90% of the population. Health care is free and it is supported by the Ministry of Health. 16 university hospitals exist in Algeria and only two (Algiers and Oran) practicing bone marrow transplant. Adult hematologic malignancies account for 10% (about 4000 new cases/year) of the malignancy affecting in most cases young patients under 65 years of age. In 2016, 270 transplants were performed in total (Algiers + Oran), including 149 allografts (related donor transplants: 99%) and 121 autografts. 98% of transplants are done in adults and only 2% in children with cord blood transplants. In summary for the two transplant centers, the predominant types of transplantation performed are allogeneic transplant in 55% and autologous transplant in 45%. The particularity of EHU1st November in Oran, is the use of non-cryopreserved stem cells. Stem cell was mobilized using G-CSF alone and the grafts were kept in a conventional blood bank refrigerator at +4 °C until reinfusion on day 0. The outcome with non-cryopreserved stem cells are the same as those with cryopreserved stem cells and we conclude that autologous transplant with non cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is a simple, effective and safe method and the cryopreservation is not necessary in our work conditions in developing countries. The projects are achieving the autograft in all University Hospitals with non cryopreserved HSC, achieving a center allograft in the east of the country and the development of bone marrow transplantation in children. Conclusion Currently in Algeria, the number of transplantation is insufficient and the development of new transplant centers is essential. In the future, we hope to implement the National Society of Bone Marrow transplant and also the National recipient registry and Donor registry in Algeria.",,"","aciclovir, cyclosporine (drug therapy), Cytomegalovirus antibody (endogenous compound), ganciclovir (drug therapy), immunoglobulin G (endogenous compound), methotrexate (drug therapy), penicillin derivative (drug therapy), trimethoprim sulfate (drug therapy)","Algeria, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","acute leukemia (therapy), age, allograft, allotransplantation, antiviral therapy, aplastic anemia (therapy), autograft, autotransplantation, bone marrow transplantation, clinical effectiveness, cord blood stem cell transplantation, cryopreservation, cytomegalovirus infection (drug therapy, prevention), developing country, disease registry, drug dose regimen, Fanconi anemia (therapy), follow up, graft versus host reaction (drug therapy, prevention), health care cost, health care facility, hematologic malignancy (therapy), Hodgkin disease (epidemiology, therapy), human, lymphoma (therapy), multiple myeloma (therapy), myelodysplastic syndrome (therapy), nonhodgkin lymphoma (epidemiology, therapy), overall survival, patient dropout, review, safety procedure, serodiagnosis, socioeconomics, thalassemia (therapy)",,,,,"aciclovir (59277-89-3), ganciclovir (82410-32-0), immunoglobulin G (97794-27-9), methotrexate (15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5), trimethoprim sulfate (56585-33-2)",,"Cancer (16), Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology (17), Hematology (25), Drug Literature Index (37)",,"English","English",20170657521,28711452,L618317891,10.1016/j.hemonc.2017.05.019,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2017.05.019",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Even with the extensive use of acyclovir, issues such as emergence of drug-resistant strains, poor oral bioavailability and low effectiveness in recurrent infections have highlighted the requirement for alternate therapies. Plants, which are rich in metabolites and active against viruses, are being explored as one such source. We had earlier reported specific and potent anti-HSV-2 activity from the roots of the plant Indigofera heterantha. Herein, we describe the mechanism by which it exerts this antiviral potential against HSV-2. Methods: MTT, plaque reduction and immunofluorescence techniques were used for in vitro antiviral studies. Animal studies were carried out in HSV-2-infected mice followed by plaque reduction assays. Results: The extract was found to act at multiple steps of viral entry viz attachment, adsorption and penetration by blocking binding sites present on the viral envelope glycoproteins which eventually blocks its binding with the cell surface receptors present on the host cells. We also showed efficacy of PP9706642 topical application in prohibiting HSV-2 invasion to nearby organs from the site of infection, that is vagina in HSV-2 infected animals. Conclusions: The extract targets the early and late stages of HSV-2 viral life cycle and thus shows great promise as both a prophylactic as well as therapeutic phytopharmaceutical against HSV-2.",,"antivirus agent (drug analysis, drug comparison, drug development, drug therapy, topical drug administration), Indigofera heterantha extract (drug analysis, drug comparison, drug development, drug therapy, topical drug administration), plant extract (drug analysis, drug comparison, drug development, drug therapy, topical drug administration)","aciclovir (drug comparison, drug therapy, topical drug administration), glycoprotein D, placebo, unclassified drug","antiviral activity, early stage of infection, general aspects of disease, Herpes simplex virus 2","animal cell, animal experiment, animal model, animal tissue, article, assay, binding site, brain, cell viability, controlled study, drug efficacy, drug mechanism, drug screening, drug targeting, female, herpes simplex (drug therapy), host cell, immunofluorescence test, in vitro study, in vivo study, Indigofera, Indigofera heterantha, life cycle, mouse, MTT assay, nonhuman, plant root, plaque reduction assay, priority journal, spinal cord, time series analysis, vagina, vaginal lavage, Vero cell line, viral life cycle, virus entry, virus load, virus titration",,,,,"aciclovir (59277-89-3)",,"Drug Literature Index (37), Microbiology: Bacteriology, Mycology, Parasitology and Virology (4)",,"English","English",20170825433,28008866,L619326711,10.3851/IMP3118,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3851/IMP3118",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab compared with interferon beta 1a in patients who have relapsed despite first-line treatment. Methods In our 2 year, rater-masked, randomised controlled phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults aged 18-55 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and at least one relapse on interferon beta or glatiramer. Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:2:2 ratio by an interactive voice response system, stratified by site, to receive subcutaneous interferon beta 1a 44 μg, intravenous alemtuzumab 12 mg per day, or intravenous alemtuzumab 24 mg per day. Interferon beta 1a was given three-times per week and alemtuzumab was given once per day for 5 days at baseline and for 3 days at 12 months. The 24 mg per day group was discontinued to aid recruitment, but data are included for safety assessments. Coprimary endpoints were relapse rate and time to 6 month sustained accumulation of disability, comparing alemtuzumab 12 mg and interferon beta 1a in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00548405. Findings 202 (87%) of 231 patients randomly allocated interferon beta 1a and 426 (98%) of 436 patients randomly allocated alemtuzumab 12 mg were included in the primary analyses. 104 (51%) patients in the interferon beta 1a group relapsed (201 events) compared with 147 (35%) patients in the alemtuzumab group (236 events; rate ratio 0·51 [95% CI 0·39-0·65]; p<0·0001), corresponding to a 49·4% improvement with alemtuzumab. 94 (47%) patients in the interferon beta 1a group were relapse-free at 2 years compared with 278 (65%) patients in the alemtuzumab group (p<0·0001). 40 (20%) patients in the interferon beta 1a group had sustained accumulation of disability compared with 54 (13%) in the alemtuzumab group (hazard ratio 0·58 [95% CI 0·38-0·87]; p=0·008), corresponding to a 42% improvement in the alemtuzumab group. For 435 patients allocated alemtuzumab 12 mg, 393 (90%) had infusion-associated reactions, 334 (77%) had infections (compared with 134 [66%] of 202 patients in the interferon beta 1a group) that were mostly mild-moderate with none fatal, 69 (16%) had thyroid disorders, and three (1%) had immune thrombocytopenia. Interpretation For patients with first-line treatment-refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab could be used to reduce relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability.

Saunders","Background & Aims Gemcitabine is the standard of care for metastatic and nonresectable pancreatic tumors. Phase II and III trials have not demonstrated efficacy of recently developed reagents, compared with gemcitabine alone; new chemotherapic agents are needed. Ninety percent of pancreatic tumors have telomerase activity, and expression correlates with tumor stage. We developed a thymidine analogue prodrug, acycloguanosyl 5′- thymidyltriphosphate (ACV-TP-T), that is metabolized by telomerase and releases the active form of acyclovir. We investigated the antitumor efficacy of ACV-TP-T in vitro and in vivo. Methods We evaluated proliferation and apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1, MiaPaca2, BxPc3, PL45, and Su.86.86) incubated with ACV-TP-T. The presence of ACV-TP-T and its metabolite inside the cells were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in nude mice carrying PANC-1 or MiaPaca2 pancreatic xenograft tumors. Results The prodrug of ACV-TP-T was actively metabolized inside pancreatic cancer cells into the activated form of acyclovir; proliferation was reduced, apoptosis was increased, and the cell cycle was altered in pancreatic cancer incubated with ACV-TP-T, compared with controls. Administration of ACV-TP-T to mice reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation and vascularization of pancreatic xenograft tumors. Conclusions ACV-TP-T, a thymidine analogue that is metabolized by telomerase and releases the active form of acyclovir, reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and pancreatic xenograft tumors in mice. © 2011 AGA Institute.",,"aciclovir (drug therapy, pharmacokinetics), acycloguanosyl 5' thymidyltriphosphate (drug development, drug dose, drug therapy, drug toxicity, intraperitoneal drug administration, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology), prodrug (drug development, drug dose, drug therapy, drug toxicity, intraperitoneal drug administration, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology), telomerase (endogenous compound), thymidine derivative (drug development, drug dose, drug therapy, drug toxicity, intraperitoneal drug administration, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology)","alanine aminotransferase (endogenous compound), aspartate aminotransferase (endogenous compound), drug metabolite, unclassified drug","cancer inhibition, pancreas cancer (drug therapy)","alanine aminotransferase blood level, animal experiment, animal model, animal tissue, antineoplastic activity, apoptosis, article, aspartate aminotransferase blood level, body weight loss, cancer cell, cell cycle G1 phase, cell cycle G2 phase, cell cycle S phase, cell proliferation, controlled study, diarrhea, dose response, drug activation, drug efficacy, drug metabolism, drug release, enzyme activity, human, human cell, IC50, mass spectrometry, mouse, nonhuman, nude mouse, priority journal, tumor vascularization, tumor volume, tumor xenograft, vomiting",,,,,"aciclovir (59277-89-3), alanine aminotransferase (9000-86-6, 9014-30-6), aspartate aminotransferase (9000-97-9)",,"Cancer (16), Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology (30), Drug Literature Index (37), Gastroenterology (48), Toxicology (52)",,"English","English",2011059771,21044629,L361179132,10.1053/j.gastro.2010.10.050,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2010.10.050",,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
